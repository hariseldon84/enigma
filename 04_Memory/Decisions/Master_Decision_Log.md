## HOW TO USE THIS LOG

Every significant decision should be captured here with:
- **Date:** When the decision was made
- **System/Project:** What this relates to
- **Context:** What was happening that required this decision
- **Decision Taken:** What was decided
- **Why:** The rationale and logic
- **Alternatives Considered:** What other options existed
- **Risks:** What could go wrong
- **Expected Outcomes:** What success looks like
- **What Would Change This Decision:** Conditions that would invalidate this choice

**This log builds institutional memory and develops Enigma's judgment over time.**

## DECISIONS LOG

### Decision: Career Move from FMCG R&D / Chemical Engineering to Startup → EdTech → Software Industry
**Date:** [Historical - Exact date unknown, captured retrospectively]
**System/Project:** Personal Career / Identity
**Phase:** Major career pivot

#### Context
Was working in FMCG R&D / Chemical Engineering background—a traditional, stable career path. Saw opportunity in startup ecosystem, edtech, and software industry. Most people disagreed with this move due to perceived risk and departure from established field.

#### Decision Taken
Left FMCG R&D / Chemical Engineering career path and moved into startup → edtech → software industry.

#### Why
- Gut conviction that technology and software would create more leverage and impact
- Traditional R&D path felt limiting for ambition scale
- Saw compounding potential in tech that didn't exist in FMCG
- Aligned better with systems thinking and building at scale
- Intuition said this was the right path despite external disagreement

#### Alternatives Considered
1. **Stay in FMCG R&D** - Rejected: Limited leverage, slower innovation cycles, less aligned with ambition
2. **Gradual transition (part-time/consulting)** - Rejected: Half-measures dilute focus and delay learning
3. **Pursue advanced degree in Chemical Engineering** - Rejected: More time in wrong domain

#### Risks
- **Career capital reset:** Starting from zero in new industry
- **Financial instability:** Less predictable income in startups
- **Skill gap:** No formal software/tech background
- **Social pressure:** Disagreement from peers and family

#### Expected Outcomes
- Faster learning curve in high-leverage domain
- Ability to build and scale products
- Greater alignment with long-term ambition (billion-dollar empire)
- More control over destiny vs corporate ladder

#### What Would Change This Decision
- If leverage in tech disappeared (unlikely)
- If personal capabilities proved fundamentally mismatched (learn by doing would reveal)
- If financial sustainability became impossible (manage through hustle)

#### Status
✅ **Validated**

#### Outcome Review
Decision was correct. Led to:
- Building Apeejay internal systems (FABS, LMS, ERP)
- Creating Cadence Infotech (external product company)
- Deep experience in product, systems, AI, and strategic thinking
- Foundation for SingleBrief, MONO, Product Genome, and entire ecosystem
- Validation that gut instinct + data > consensus opinion

**Key Learning:** Conviction-based irreversible decisions, when aligned with first principles and intuition, compound over time. External disagreement is often noise when internal clarity exists.

## DECISION REVIEW CADENCE

**Monthly:** Review recent decisions for early signals (validating or invalidating)
**Quarterly:** Deep review of major decisions from past 3-6 months
**Annually:** Full retrospective on all significant decisions of the year

**Enigma's Role:** Surface past decisions relevant to current situations. Identify patterns in decision-making. Flag when conditions have changed that might invalidate old decisions.
