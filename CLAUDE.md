This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

Enigma is a personal knowledge management system organized into numbered categories representing different aspects of work and life organization.

## Directory Structure and Purpose

The repository uses a numbered prefix system to establish hierarchy and organization:

- **00_Doctrine/** - Foundational principles, guidelines, and core philosophies that inform all other categories
- **01_Skills_And_Education/** - Learning resources, skill development, and educational materials
- **02_Systems/** - System documentation, processes, and operational procedures
- **03_Projects/** - Active and archived project documentation
- **04_Memory/** - Organized into three subcategories:
  - `Decisions/` - Decision logs and rationale
  - `Experiments/` - Experimental work and outcomes
  - `Learnings/` - Knowledge captured from experience
- **05_Tasks/** - Task tracking and management
- **06_Derived/** - Auto-generated or synthesized content derived from other sources
- **99_GroundTruth/** - Canonical reference information and authoritative sources

## Organization Principles

The numbered prefix system (00-99) creates an intentional hierarchy where:
- Lower numbers (00-01) represent foundational/input content
- Middle numbers (02-05) represent active work and processes
- Higher numbers (06, 99) represent outputs and reference materials

When creating or organizing content, respect this hierarchy by placing information in the appropriate category based on its nature and role in the knowledge system.
