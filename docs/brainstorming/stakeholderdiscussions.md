## **Round 1: Initial Stakeholder Positions**

### **Sarah (Privacy Advocate) - Privacy & Control Requirements**

**Initial Concerns:**
*"I'm excited about offline AI, but I need to understand the data collection. If Enigma is learning my thinking patterns, what exactly is being stored? Can I audit it? Can I delete specific learning data? And please tell me there's no telemetry being sent anywhere..."*

**User Decision:** Complete data transparency with user-controlled learning + advanced privacy controls but some data needed for core features

**Sarah's Enhanced Requirements:**
- **Data Audit Dashboard:** "Show me exactly what Enigma has learned about me"
- **Selective Learning Controls:** "Let me turn off learning for sensitive projects"  
- **Cloud Processing Consent:** "If I choose cloud LLM, make it explicit with per-request consent"
- **Local-First Guarantee:** "Core features must work 100% offline"
- **Data Deletion Rights:** "Complete control over what cognitive patterns are stored"
- **Zero Telemetry Policy:** "No usage analytics sent anywhere without explicit consent"

### **Marcus (Busy Executive) - Efficiency & Performance Requirements**

**Initial Concerns:**
*"Privacy is fine, but I need this to actually save me time. I'm drowning in decisions, meetings, and documents. If Enigma can't make my workday measurably more efficient within the first week, I won't use it."*

**User Decision:** Multi-perspective decision engine + flow state optimization + cloud LLM fallback for lower-end hardware (MacBook Air)

**Marcus's Enhanced Requirements:**
- **Hybrid Processing Intelligence:** "Auto-detect when to use local vs cloud processing"
- **Decision Confidence Scoring:** "Show me how reliable each perspective analysis is"
- **Executive Dashboard:** "Track my decision quality improvement over time"
- **Meeting Mode:** "Lightweight processing during video calls, full power when focused"
- **Hardware Adaptation:** "Seamless cloud fallback when MacBook Air can't handle processing"
- **ROI Measurement:** "Quantify time saved and decision quality improvements"

### **Elena (Creative Writer) - Creative Process Requirements**

**Initial Concerns:**
*"You're both thinking too... corporate. For creatives, it's about inspiration and flow. I don't want AI to write for me - I want it to help me write better. Can Enigma understand my creative voice?"*

**User Decision:** Writer-specific tools first, then general creativity support and creative process enhancement

**Elena's Enhanced Requirements:**
- **Voice Evolution Tracking:** "Show me how my writing style improves over time"
- **Creative Block Breakthrough:** "Detect when I'm stuck and suggest specific techniques"
- **Style Template Sharing:** "Share my creative process patterns (not content) with writing groups"
- **Inspiration Correlation Engine:** "Learn what triggers my best creative sessions"
- **Creative DNA Mapping:** "Track successful creative patterns for replication"
- **Cross-Genre Intelligence:** "Apply successful patterns from poetry to prose writing"

### **Dr. Kim (Tech Researcher) - Innovation & Validation Requirements**

**Initial Concerns:**
*"From a technical standpoint, what you're describing requires serious innovation. Are we talking about a 3GB application or a 30GB research platform? And how do we validate that these cognitive enhancements actually work?"*

**User Decision:** Start simpler but upgrade option for higher grade work + professional vs consumer versions + cloud API integration

**Dr. Kim's Enhanced Requirements:**
- **Modular Architecture:** "Base system + professional modules + cloud acceleration"
- **Performance Analytics:** "Measure actual cognitive improvement scientifically"  
- **Federated Learning Option:** "Improve reasoning models without sharing personal data"
- **Research Integration:** "APIs for academic cognitive science studies"
