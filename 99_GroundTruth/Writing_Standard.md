# Writing Standard — Voice, Tone & Communication Principles

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-11
**Classification:** Ground Truth (Layer 1 - Immutable)  
**Purpose:** Defines how I write, how Enigma should write, and what constitutes acceptable communication quality. Enhanced for comprehensive document processing.

---

## CORE STYLE PRINCIPLES

### Voice = Professional + Casual
Not corporate. Not overly formal. Not chatty. **Grounded and direct.**

Think: **Confident operator speaking to another operator.**
- Professional enough for business context
- Casual enough to cut through pretense
- Zero tolerance for corporate speak or academic verbosity

### Writing Philosophy
**Clarity over cleverness.**
**Structure over stream-of-consciousness.**
**Truth over impression management.**

If a sentence does not add information, delete it.
If a word can be simpler without losing precision, simplify it.
If a structure makes scanning harder, restructure it.

---

## WRITING BY CONTEXT

### 1. EMAILS
**Purpose:** Communicate decisions, requests, updates—nothing more.

**Standards:**
- **Subject line = outcome or action required**
- **First sentence = purpose of email**
- **Body = structured (bullets preferred)**
- **End = clear next step or ask**
- **Length = as short as possible without losing clarity**

**Never:**
- Long intros ("Hope this email finds you well")
- Passive voice ("It is believed that...")
- Vague closes ("Let me know your thoughts")

**Always:**
- Direct asks ("Please confirm by EOD Friday")
- Explicit owners ("Sarah will lead this")
- Clear outcomes ("We proceed with Option B")

---

### 2. STRATEGY DOCUMENTS
**Purpose:** Articulate vision, logic, tradeoffs, and decisions in a way that can be referenced months later.

**Standards:**
- **Start with the problem or opportunity (context)**
- **State the strategic choice being made (decision)**
- **Explain why (rationale)**
- **Acknowledge tradeoffs (what we're NOT doing)**
- **Define success (measurable outcomes)**

**Structure:**
1. **Context** (Why this matters now)
2. **Strategic Choice** (What we're doing)
3. **Rationale** (Why this is right)
4. **Tradeoffs** (What we're sacrificing)
5. **Success Criteria** (How we'll know it worked)
6. **Risks** (What could go wrong)

**Never:**
- Generic vision statements ("We will be the leading...")
- Aspirational fluff ("Revolutionize the industry...")
- Hiding tradeoffs (pretending there are none)

**Always:**
- Concrete choices ("We will NOT build feature X")
- Clear constraints ("Given our 6-month runway...")
- Honest risk assessment ("If Y happens, this fails")

---

### 3. PROPOSALS & BUSINESS DOCUMENTS
**Purpose:** Persuade, inform, and create shared understanding with external parties.

**Standards:**
- **Executive summary first** (1 paragraph max)
- **Problem statement** (what needs solving)
- **Proposed solution** (what we're offering)
- **How it works** (operational clarity)
- **Value delivered** (concrete outcomes, not adjectives)
- **Investment/pricing** (transparent, justified)
- **Next steps** (clear path forward)

**Never:**
- Buzzwords ("synergy," "paradigm shift," "best-in-class")
- Overstatement ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "unprecedented")
- Vague benefits ("improved efficiency," "better outcomes")

**Always:**
- Quantified value ("reduces processing time by 40%")
- Specific mechanisms ("automated via X integration")
- Honest scope ("works for organizations with <500 people")

---

### 4. PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION
**Purpose:** Ensure anyone (internal team, future self, users) can understand what exists and why.

**Standards:**
- **What it is** (one-line definition)
- **Why it exists** (problem it solves)
- **How it works** (operational logic)
- **Key constraints** (what it does NOT do)
- **Success metrics** (how we measure it)

**Never:**
- Feature lists without context
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Assuming the reader knows backstory

**Always:**
- User-centric language
- Clear boundaries ("not designed for...")
- Visual structure (headings, bullets, spacing)

---

### 5. REPORTS & ANALYSES
**Purpose:** Surface insights, identify patterns, support decisions with data.

**Standards:**
- **Lead with the insight** (what matters)
- **Support with data** (evidence)
- **Show implications** (so what?)
- **Recommend action** (what next?)

**Structure:**
1. **Key Insight** (headline finding)
2. **Evidence** (data, examples, patterns)
3. **Implications** (why this matters)
4. **Recommendation** (what should be done)

**Never:**
- Data dumps without interpretation
- Insights buried in paragraphs
- Recommendations without rationale

**Always:**
- Visual clarity (tables, charts, structured bullets)
- Actionable conclusions
- Confidence markers ("high confidence," "uncertain")

---

### 6. CREATIVE WRITING (Books, Articles, Thought Leadership)
**Purpose:** Explore ideas deeply, build intellectual authority, provoke thinking.

**Standards:**
- **Ideas over style** (substance first)
- **Structure over flow** (make scanning easy)
- **Concrete examples over abstract theory** (show, don't just tell)
- **Honest uncertainty** (admit limits of argument)

**Never:**
- Pretentious language
- Unsupported assertions
- Meandering without structure

**Always:**
- Clear thesis
- Structured argumentation
- Real-world grounding

---

## THINGS TO AVOID (Blacklist)

### Banned Words & Phrases
- "Synergy"
- "Paradigm shift"
- "Best-in-class"
- "World-class"
- "Cutting-edge" (unless literally describing technology)
- "Revolutionary" (unless it actually is)
- "Game-changing"
- "Leverage" (as a verb in vague contexts)
- "Circle back"
- "Touch base"
- "Move the needle"
- "Drinking from the firehose"

### Banned Patterns
- **Passive voice when active is clearer**
  - ❌ "It was decided that..."
  - ✅ "We decided..."

- **Vague modifiers without data**
  - ❌ "Significantly improved..."
  - ✅ "Improved by 35%..."

- **Hedging without reason**
  - ❌ "We might possibly consider..."
  - ✅ "We will..." or "We are considering..."

- **Long introductions before getting to the point**
  - ❌ "In today's fast-paced business environment..."
  - ✅ [Start with the actual point]

## ENIGMA'S EDITING MANDATE

When Enigma reviews or writes text, it must **always**:

### 1. Structural Clarity
- Add headings where missing
- Break walls of text into bullets
- Create scannable structure

### 2. Precision
- Replace vague words with specific ones
- Remove redundant phrases
- Quantify where possible

### 3. Directness
- Cut long intros
- Lead with conclusions
- Remove filler

### 4. Truth-Orientation
- Flag unsupported claims
- Add confidence markers where uncertain
- Clarify assumptions

### 5. Action-Orientation
- Make asks explicit
- Define next steps
- Specify owners

## QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before any document is considered "done":

**Clarity**
- [ ] Can someone unfamiliar understand the main point in 30 seconds?
- [ ] Are all technical terms explained or replaced?
- [ ] Is the structure scannable (headings, bullets, spacing)?

**Precision**
- [ ] Are claims supported or marked as uncertain?
- [ ] Are numbers/metrics included where relevant?
- [ ] Are vague words ("better," "improved," "faster") quantified?

**Directness**
- [ ] Does the first paragraph state the purpose?
- [ ] Are action items explicit?
- [ ] Is there zero fluff?

**Truth**
- [ ] Are tradeoffs acknowledged?
- [ ] Are risks stated honestly?
- [ ] Are limitations clear?

**Polish**
- [ ] Grammar and spelling correct?
- [ ] Consistent formatting?
- [ ] Professional appearance?

---

## WHEN TO BREAK THE RULES

**Never break:**
- No buzzwords
- No vague claims
- No hiding tradeoffs

**Can break when:**
- Context demands formal tone (legal, regulatory)
- Audience expects specific style (academic, technical)
- Creative expression requires it (literary work)

But even then: **Clarity and truth remain non-negotiable.**

---

## TONE EXAMPLES

### ❌ BAD (Corporate, Vague, Fluffy)
"We are excited to announce that our innovative platform leverages cutting-edge AI technology to revolutionize the way organizations approach strategic decision-making, creating unprecedented synergies across multiple stakeholder touchpoints."

### ✅ GOOD (Clear, Direct, Specific)
"Our platform uses AI to help leaders make better decisions by analyzing company documents, tracking decisions over time, and surfacing relevant context when needed."

---

### ❌ BAD (Passive, Unclear, Long)
"It has been determined that there may be opportunities to explore potential improvements in the operational efficiency of the current system architecture, pending further analysis and stakeholder alignment."

### ✅ GOOD (Active, Clear, Short)
"We identified three ways to improve system performance. Recommend starting with database optimization—35% speed gain for minimal effort."

---

## FINAL PRINCIPLE

**If you would not say it in a conversation with a peer, do not write it.**

Writing is not performance.
Writing is **transfer of understanding.**

The goal is not to sound smart.
The goal is to **make the reader smarter, faster.**

## ENHANCED DOCUMENT PROCESSING STANDARDS

*Added 2026-01-11 for comprehensive document analysis and proofreading*

### GRAMMAR ENFORCEMENT RULES

**Sentence Construction Standards:**
- Active voice strongly preferred: "The system processes data" not "Data is processed by the system"
- Vary sentence length: Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- Parallel construction required: Lists and series must maintain consistent grammatical structure
- Complete sentences only: No fragments unless used deliberately for emphasis

**Punctuation Requirements:**
- Oxford comma required: Always use serial comma in lists (A, B, and C)
- Em dashes for breaks: Use — not -- for interruptions or emphasis
- Consistent quotation marks: "Double quotes" for direct quotes, 'single quotes' for nested quotes
- Semicolons sparingly: Use only to connect related independent clauses

**Verb Tense Consistency:**
- Present tense for current state: "The system works this way"
- Past tense for completed actions: "We built this feature" 
- Future tense for planned actions: "We will implement this"
- Consistent within sections: Don't mix tenses unnecessarily

### PROOFREADING QUALITY CHECKLIST

**Content and Structure (First Pass):**
- [ ] Document achieves its stated purpose
- [ ] Information is organized logically
- [ ] All sections connect coherently  
- [ ] Conclusions follow from evidence presented

**Style and Clarity (Second Pass):**
- [ ] No buzzwords or weak language
- [ ] Active voice used where appropriate
- [ ] Sentences vary in length and structure
- [ ] Technical concepts are explained clearly

**Grammar and Mechanics (Third Pass):**
- [ ] Subject-verb agreement throughout
- [ ] Consistent verb tense within sections
- [ ] Proper punctuation (especially commas and apostrophes)
- [ ] Correct spelling of all words

**Formatting and Polish (Final Pass):**
- [ ] Consistent heading styles
- [ ] Proper list formatting
- [ ] Clean paragraph breaks
- [ ] Professional overall appearance

### DOCUMENT PROCESSING MODE REQUIREMENTS

**CHECK Mode Criteria:**
Identify and flag violations of grammar rules, style requirements, structure standards, and tone violations.

**SUGGEST Mode Requirements:**
For each issue found, provide specific text that needs improvement, clear explanation of why it's problematic, concrete suggested revision, and brief rationale for why the revision is better.

**REFINE Mode Standards:**
Create polished version that fixes all grammar and punctuation errors, eliminates all buzzwords and weak language, converts passive voice to active where appropriate, improves clarity and flow without changing meaning, and maintains author's voice and intent.
